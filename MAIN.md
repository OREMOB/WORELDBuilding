## üìù Abstract

The OREOREORE brand and OREMOB collection have enormous potential for innovation, development, and growth within the "physi-digital" web3 arena. With an exceptional artist and a compelling vision, a passionate following and community, a talented and motivated team, and a robust operational foundation and network, the ingredients for success are here.

The upcoming phase of brand development and growth is likely to be the most challenging. The brand achieved huge initial success, but the hype and novelty have worn off, the floor price is dropping and everybody is waiting for what comes next. This is the stage where brands and projects begin to stumble. The issue of "what's next" is an ever-present challenge, but it's especially dangerous in the early stages. Establishing a strong track record at this point is crucial for building trust and credibility.

In addition there is the issue of cash flow. Developing a sustainable business model is crucial for any brand looking to expand, scale, and maintain their existing services. While this document won't delve into the specifics of creating such a model, it's worth emphasizing the importance of doing so to ensure long-term success.

The objectives going forward are three-fold: firstly, to deliver on existing milestones; secondly, to develop and establish new milestones; and thirdly, to continue to grow the brand and community. Given the small team, limited funding, and significant logistical and technical complexities related to web3 development, it will also be important during this phase to establish systems that help the team work more effectively and efficiently.

This design doc has two aims: firstly, to propose a concept world and content framework which will serve as a starting point for the team to begin thinking about and weaving together world elements, lore and content into a unified and cohesive experience. Secondly, the document aims to present several ideas pertaining to future collections and tokenization, content and lore, gamification, project management, and brand growth.

## üéØ Guiding Principles

**üìè Flexible Design:** As the OREMOB world begins to take shape, it's crucial to maintain flexibility while establishing the rules and parameters that govern the world. Too many rigid constraints can hinder development and stifle creativity.

**üî≤ Modular Design:** Modularity is a useful design strategy that improves flexibility and scalability by dividing a system into smaller, self-contained modules. This approach allows for easier maintenance and testing, faster development cycles, and the ability to update or change one module without affecting the entire system.

**üí° Inspired Innovation:** When contemplating the world and its content, it's crucial to consider and reflect on the fundamental aesthetic themes and principles that inspire Ole's vision and work.

**üåê A Limitless World:** Artists are driven by their passions, ideas, and interests, which are ever-changing and seemingly limitless. The world should be equally limitless; capable of evolving and expanding seamlessly to accommodate the whole of Ole's (and the team's) artistic passion, creativity, ideas and vision.

**Iterative/Incremental design:** ...

## üåé Part 1: Concept World & Content Framework

*"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. - The Bible"*

World building is the art of creating a fictional reality that is internally consistent, believable, and immersive. It involves the careful calibration and weaving together of world components, principles, characters and content to create an atmosphere that is alive and real. Geography, cities, landmarks, culture, history, technology, peoples and races are just a few of the elements that are used.

<hr></hr>

### ‚≠ê 1a: Maps and Postcards.

**‚úç Overview & Features**

- The world interface will be comprised of maps and/or postcard components.
- These components will be used to define the world's locations and provide a navigation interface for users.
- The depth and scope of the world can be adjusted easily to accommodate new content.
    - For example, the scope of a given map could be enlarged by expanding the borders to include a new area.
    - To illustrate world depth: imagine the world has three levels - regions, cities and streets. Clicking on a region would zoom the user in to a more detailed map showing the cities in that region. Clicking on a city would zoom the user in to a street-level map showing all the points of interests, locations, vendors and activities.
    - Note: The depth, scope and complexity is up for discussion. Maps could span continents containing many cities and locations, or be confined to a single very detailed city.


**ü§∑ Pros & Cons**
- ‚úÖ Resource-efficient in the browser.
- ‚úÖ Easier to create a mobile-friendly experience.
- ‚úÖ Simpler and cost-effective to build.
- ‚úÖ Opens the door to multi-chain opportunities.
- ‚úÖ Offers a significant amount of creative flexibility.
- ‚úÖ This system can be developed iteratively, starting with something simple and gradually building in complexity. This approach encourages regular, small updates which the community will appreciate.

**ü§ü Misc. Notes & Ideas:**

- The OREMOB backgrounds are interesting. I can imagine that style being used.
- Layered "dynamic images" that use parallax and field of vision effects can be used to create a sense of motion and dimensionality.
- A variety of thematic regions would be cool i.e. urban, wilderness.

<hr></hr>

### ‚≠ê 1b: Content modules

**‚úç Overview & Features**

- Content modules contain groups of "scenes" which offer the user access to world activities.
- A content module is accessed by clicking on a map icon or postcard element.

<hr></hr>

### ‚≠ê 1c: Scenes

**‚úç Overview & Features**

- Scenes are where we begin to interact with the world.
- Scenes are primarily made up of static images yet we can create motion and dimensionality by layering them and using visual effects.
- There are two types of scenes...
  - Navigation scenes are used to navigate within the content module. For example...
    - You click on a warehouse map icon or postcard. The warehouse represents a content module.
    - Your view changes to a scene inside the warehouse. You can click on different characters which will take you to different activities. You can click on Bob, Jim, Joe or John.
  - Activity scenes are used to participate and interact with the world. For example...
    - Within the warehouse you click on Bob.
    - The scene changes and now you're sitting directly in front of "Bob the Shoe Guy" (his activity scene).
    - Within Bob's activity scene, you can browse a selection of shoes that he's selling.
    - Buying a pair prompts you to sign a transaction to receive an NFT.

## üåé Part 2: Ideas

<hr></hr>

### ‚≠ê 2a: Future Collections & Tokenization

**Safehouses / Safehouse keychains**

- Safehouses would act as the user homebase within the OREMOB world.
- When first coming to the world, a user can access their safehouse by minting a "safehouse keychain" which lives in their wallet.
- The keychain is 3D and rotating.
- Safehouse keychains are upgraded by completing missions for different factions. Upgrades affect the functionality and visual appearance of the keychain.
  - Faction keys and/or bobbles are added after successful missions.
  - Once you have a faction key/bobble on your keychain, you can access exclusive faction areas forever without holding a specific mob NFT.
- Safehouses would contain a variety of activities for the user.
  - A customizable mob calendar book that displays mob dates and events.
  - A wardrobe area
    - The mirror could have polaroid "mob shots" taped to it.
    - The wardrobe area is where you can start to customize your custom floater.
    - This area could have a jewelry box where you can look at your charm rings and other jewelry.
  - A vault
  - A mob liquor cabinet.
  - A bonsai tree and small zen garden.
  - A collection of "Mob Records" vinyl cases and a record player.
  - A fridge with pictures taped on it. Mob ramen inside?
  - A pet area
  - A katana case
- Safehouses would be publically available like pool.pm - you could visit a users safehouse by typing in oreworld.com/$walletName and see how they had decked it out. This gives a sense of multiplayer.

**Player floaters, Player mobs & In-game Items**

- When entering the world, players will have the chance to mint a new base floater/character that represents an "account" in the world/game. I will touch on the mechanics of this new floater and its relationship to the OREMOB 10k collection in the gamification section. Players can mint more than 1.
- This floater will represet the player. The visal appearance will be different than the 10k (We don't want to water down the 10k).
- As the player collects items, embarks on missions, and otherwise interacts with the world - rewards can be used to customize the appearance and stats of the player floater.
- Players also have the ability to establish their own custom mob faction. I will also touch on this in gamification.

**XP/Credits Device**

- If we're going to gameify this world, we need a mechanism for storing data on-chain using a token.
- In fallout, they have the Pip-boy - a wrist accessory that contains information.
- I'm thinking we do something similar (doesn't need to be a wearable item), perhaps a Mob Piggy Bank that is capable of displaying how many credits you have.
- It can also display other information, the piggy bank can be connected to the custom floater, so there is only one, and that can transferred in case a user sends his tokens to a new wallet.

**Mob Records**

- Within the OREMOB world, MOB Records is a music label that produces all of the soundtracks.
  - Tracks can be bought (minted) within the world. These can be limited edition.
  - The token would be a 3D vinyl record case with the vinyl record resting slightly outside the case.
  - Users can configure certain tracks to play when other people visit their safehouse.

**Mob Pets / Mob Sidekicks**

- I've been brainstorming on how we can leverage Ole's talent to produce more collections (without watering anything down). Collections are a great way to raise more capital to fund future development (which will be necessary unless ADA moons sooner than expected).
- An OREMOB pets/sidekicks collection would is one such possibility for another collection. These could have PFP capabilities, but also play a role in the gameified world.
- Sidekicks could act as a small in-world character that lived in the players safehouse. Perhaps it would be some kind of cybernetic cyberpunk creature thing. This could also be a PFP.
- This would also allow Ole to create the best looking animal PFP on Cardano (he's already done humans haha).

**Multi-Chain Collections**

- This would be way down the line, but in the event the team has the resources, and the community is on board, and we set everything up properly. I don't think it would be a bad idea necessarily to launch a collection on Ethereum, and expand the world to have ETH specific regions, locations and factions. This would also introduce the possibility of chain-based faction wars.

**Mob Trading Cards, dice, bones (In-world games)**

- I think we should develop "in-world games" (Gwent from The Witcher 3) that involves using collectible trading cards, dice or other items.
- Players can play against each other or an AI.


**Mob Legends**

- Mob legends would be prominent world characters.
- They could be main characters in the Manga episodes.
- These characters could be the basis of a trading card game as well.

**Mob Manga Episodes**

- A manga-style story that takes place in the world.
- Episodes could be tokenized and sold within the world.
- Episodes should be exclusive and there should be rarity involved.
- Purchasing a comic episode should also come with a free trading card.

**Mob Weapons & Gadgets**

**Mob Gardening: Bonsai Trees, Zen Garden**

### ‚≠ê 2b: Content & Lore

**Content types**

The content types are as follows. I will touch on these in greater detail in the gamification section.

- Missions/Quests/Assignments
- Duels
- Raids
- Vendors
- In-world games
- Pets/Animals
- Weapons/Blacksmith
- Manga episodes
- Gardening
- In-game exchange
- General Customization

**Lore**

- World lore: Lore pertaining to the world at large.
- Location lore: Special locations can have lore.
- Floater lore: I don't floaters from the 10k should have lore.
- Elite
- Boss lore
- Legend lore
- Faction lore

<hr></hr>

### ‚≠ê 2c: Gamification

**10k OREMOB**

- The purpose of OREMOB NFTs within the world and game are to provide utility, access and stats to the player and the player's mob.
- OREMOB NFTs can be thought of as characters within the world. The player does not control them directly per se, but by owning the NFT, that character becomes aligned with the player and his mob.
- Each OREMOB NFT has stats. By owning that token, the stats are added to the players "meta stats" (mob stats) which dictate things mission performance, influence, territory etc.
- OREMOB NFTs can also grant access to exclusive areas and exclusive content. A Cardano Corp NFT opens up the Cardano Corp faction content to the player.

**Player floaters & Player mobs**

- When first joining the world, players will mint a "player floater" to represent them. As we just mentioned, the OREMOB 10k ownerships adds to a player's meta stats and is associated with mission performance, mob strength, access etc. but in theory the game can still be played without owning a single OREMOB 10k NFT.
- Player floaters are focused on completing missions, collecting and upgrading items, making alliances, upgrading their mob stats and so on. Gameplay loops will be built around these elements.
- Each player floater will also establish a mob when they join the world. Player mobs are simply mechanisms to introduce the idea of "meta stats" or mob stats. Meta stats are used to determine things like success liklihood on certain missions.
- The OREMOB 10k NFTs that a player owns are automatically aligned with the players mob, and collectively increase the meta stats and enable access to faction exclusive content.
- Players can mint and create multiple floaters. This also creates the ability to upgrade and sell them.

**Safehouses**

- Safehouses are player bases.
- Players can mint multiple safehouse keychains.
- Players can upgrade their safehouse keychains with faction excluisve bobbles.
  - These bobbles allow a player to change the theme of their safehouse.
- Players can mint multiple safehouses keychains.

**Missions & Quests**

- Missions and quests are undertaken by a player (solo) and/or the player's mob (mob).
- Missions earn the player and their mob items, access, progression, money, stats, achievements etc.
- There can be different kind of missions:
  - Basic missions.
  - Vendor assigned missions.
  - Faction assigned missions.
  - Legend assigned missions.
- Mission success/failure mechanics:
  - Probability-based: A player is given a probability before undertaking the mission. The software calculates success of failure by simulating rounds and taking into account a player's stats and their mob stats. These missions can also time-lock a player. While they're on a mission - they can't do other stuff.
  - Puzzle-based: A player can solve a puzzle to complete a mission.
- Solo vs. mob missions:
  - Solo missions are undertaken by the player only. Their mob stats are not taken into account.
  - Mob missions can leverage the strength of your entire mob.

**Duels**

- Duelling is an activity where your player floater faces off against another player floater or NPC.
- This activity does not require multiplayer networking and is very resource efficient.
- Duels are probability based like D&D rolls and take place in rounds.
- You can challenge another player at the dojo. They do not need to be online. You can enter their wallet handle or username.
- You must pay a price to duel the player.
- If you win, you receive stats, and some cash.
- If you lose, the cash is transferred to the other player.
- Players can select items they own to be "duel bounties"...if you beat a player, you also win the bountied items.
- Wins and losses are public.
- This is a super fun mechanic, and does not require multiplayer networking.

**Raids**

- Raids are similar to duels but they leverage your entire mob against another mob or faction.

**Vendors**

- As you explore the city, you'll encounter vendors that sell things.
- Vendors can be locked, perhaps you need to be part of a faction, or have completed a mission to access the vendor.
- Vendors may also sell exclusive items to you under certain conditions.

**In-world games**

- In world games allow players to earn money and items by playing a trading card-based game, or dice based game.
- This would require networking to be multiplayer. Perhaps initially it will simply be AI based and the goal is to collect all the cards.
- I think we can create some other special reward types for the games. Besides earning more cards, perhaps by beating an innkeeper for example, you gain a ramen recipie.

**Pets**

- Pets like players, have stats and contribute to a mob stats.
- There will be pet exclusive missions.
- Pets can be customized in many ways.

**Weapons & The Blacksmith**

- Weapons are cosmetic tokens that are stored in a player's safehouse.
- Weapons augment a player's stats and affect duelling outcomes.
- Weapons can be upgraded and visually changed at the blacksmith.

**Manga episodes**

- A manga-style comic set in the world.

**Customization**

- Customization is at the heart of this entire gaming experience. As much as possible, we want to allow players to customize the cosmetics and behavior of all their items, animals and properties in the game.
